      <h5 class="w3-center">Ingredients:</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"></p>

<h6>1 pound (450g) dry pasta</h6>
<h6>Kosher salt</h6>
<h6>4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced</h6>
<h6>6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided</h6>
<h6>1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes (about 2 pints; 750g)</h6>
<h6>1 ounce fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (about 1 cup; 30g)</h6>
<h6>Freshly ground black pepper
Parmesan cheese, for serving</h6>
</p>
</ul>
      <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium">
     <h5 class="w3-center">Directions:</h5>  	

<h6>1. Place pasta in a large skillet or sauté pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt. Bring
to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute
less than the package instructions recommend.</h6>

<h6>2. Meanwhile, heat garlic and 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium
heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes
and cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst. You can help them along by pressing on them
with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.</h6>

<h6>4. When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water. Add pasta to sauce and
increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding reserved pasta
water as necessary to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow. Remove from heat, stir in
remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese.
Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan at the table.</h6>

   <h1 class="w3-center">PASTA WITH BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND SAGE BROWN BUTTER</h1><br>
  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-64" id="menu">
    <div class="w3-col l6 w3-padding-large">
     <h5 class="w3-center">Ingredients:</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"></p>

<h6>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (30ml)</h6>
<h6> 1 pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (450g; about 1/2 large
squash)</h6>
<h6>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</h6>
<h6>1 small shallot, finely minced (about 1 ounce; 30g)</h6>
<h6>1 tablespoon juice from 1 lemon (15ml)(30g)</h6>
<h6>1 pound small cupped, tubular, or ridged pasta such as orecchiette, penne, farfalle, or rotini
(450g)(30g)</h6>
<h6>1 ounce grated fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (30g)</h6>

</p>
<h5 class="w3-center">Directions:</h5>  	

<h6>1. Heat olive oil in a large stainless steel or cast-iron skillet over high heat until very lightly
smoking. Immediately add squash, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring and
tossing occasionally, until well-browned and squash is tender, about 5 minutes. Add butter
and shallots and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until butter is lightly browned and
smells nutty, about 1 minute longer. Add sage and stir to combine (sage should crackle and
let off a great aroma). Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Set aside.</h6>
<h6>2. In a medium saucepan, combine pasta with enough room temperature or hot water to cover
by about 2 inches. Season with salt. Set over high heat and bring to a boil while stirring
frequently. Cook, stirring frequently, until pasta is just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than
the package directions. Drain pasta, reserving a couple cups of the starchy cooking liquid.</h6>
<h6>3. Add pasta to skillet with squash along with a splash of pasta water. Bring to a simmer over
high heat and cook until the pasta is perfectly al dente, stirring and tossing constantly and
adding a splash of water as needed to keep the sauce loose and shiny. Off heat, stir in
Parmigiano-Reggiano. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and texture with more pasta water
as needed. Serve immediately, topped with more cheese at the table.</h6>

<h6>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</h6>

<h6>2. In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until
shimmering, Add reserved shrimp shells and cook, stirring constantly, until they&#39;ve all turned a
reddish color, about 4 minutes. Off the heat, remove the shells using tongs, a slotted spatula,

Add shrimp and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until the sauce reduces and clings to
pasta and the shrimp are fully heated through; add more pasta water as necessary if the sauce
becomes too dry. Season with salt, if necessary.</h6>

<h6>6. Stir in parsley and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Serve right away.</h6>
